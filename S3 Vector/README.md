# S3 Vector Service: Semantic Vector Search with Amazon S3 Vectors

This repository contains a Python service implementation for managing and querying semantic vector embeddings using Amazon S3 Vectors. The S3VectorService class provides comprehensive methods to store, update, query, and delete vectors within an S3 Vector Index.

## What is Amazon S3 Vectors?

Amazon S3 Vectors is a purpose-built cloud object storage service designed to natively store, manage, and query vector embeddings at scale. It is the first cloud storage service with native vector support, enabling cost-optimized, elastic, and durable storage of vector data, ideal for AI, machine learning, and semantic search applications.

Amazon S3 Vectors delivers:

- **Cost-efficient storage** reducing total costs of vector storage and querying by up to 90%.
- **Scalability** to store billions of vectors with sub-second query performance.
- **Ease of use** with dedicated APIs to store, query, and manage vectors without infrastructure provisioning.
- **Strong consistency** guarantees ensuring immediate availability of fresh vector data.
- **Metadata support** enabling filtering and fine-grained query control on stored vectors.

## How Does Amazon S3 Vectors Work?

- Vectors are numeric embeddings representing unstructured data (text, images, audio).
- Vectors are stored in **vector buckets**, organized into **vector indexes** within S3.
- You can perform **similarity searches** by querying for vectors closest to a given query vector embedding.
- Amazon S3 Vectors supports adding **metadata** to vectors to enable filtering during queries.
- S3 Vectors automatically optimizes storage and performance as datasets expand.

## Vector Search Algorithm and Similarity

Amazon S3 Vectors uses vector embeddings generated by machine learning models (e.g., from text or images) to represent semantic meanings as numerical vectors.

- Similarity between vectors is computed using mathematical distance or similarity measures such as **cosine similarity** or **Euclidean distance**.
- Vectors close in this multidimensional vector space are considered semantically similar.
- Queries involve finding the top-k vectors closest to a query vector, efficiently performed by indexing methods optimized for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search at scale.

Note: Amazon S3 Vectors abstracts the underlying indexing and ANN algorithms, providing a highly optimized managed service without the need for manual indexing configuration.

## Features of This Service

- Store vectors with associated metadata in an S3 Vector Index.
- Update vectors and their metadata individually or in batches.
- Query the vector index by semantic similarity with optional metadata filtering.
- Retrieve and delete vectors by unique keys.
- Utility methods for vector count, distance calculation, and integration with embedding services.
